## About

This project is a class project for a course by Gustavo Pezzi at the University of Oxford. I'm taking
this course through his website [Pikuma](https://www.pikuma.com/). Once I've completed this project
I will be expanding it, possibly switching over to C++ and implementing threading and more
advanced algorithms for drawing triangles, shading, etc.
