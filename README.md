# 3DRenderer

## About

This is a CPU-Based 3D Graphics Renderer built from scratch without any graphics libraries such as OpenGL or
DirectX. This project is a class project for a course by Gustavo Pezzi at the University of Oxford. I'm taking
this course through his website [Pikuma](https://www.pikuma.com/).

Some of the assets are taken from Stanford's Graphic Repository and some are provided by Professor Pezzi.

I'm using a PNG library called upng, which I did not develop myself.
